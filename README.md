# Computer-Vision-Basics
There is a repository that contains my first computer vision projects using the OpenCV library, which I developed during my studies at FIT CTU. These projects demonstrate that I have a solid theoretical understanding in the field of computer vision. Using OpenCV, I have tackled image processing tasks such as filtering, morphology, geometric transformations, segmentation, and more. This repository also includes work with images from depth and thermal cameras.

## Projects
- [Segmentation basics](#Segmentation-basics)

## Segmentation basics
The goal of this task is to implement the **calculation of the shortest distance between rectangles** on a given source image.
